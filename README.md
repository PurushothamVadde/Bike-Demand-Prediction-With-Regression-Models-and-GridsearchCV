## Business Understanding
#### Project Goal:
The goal of the project is to work on the Bike share Dataset and predict the demand of Bikes sharing on daily basis by building the Regression Models and GridsearchCV.
#### Practical use:
* The project will help the Bike Sharing Companies to solve the realtime problems such as:
    * By knowing the demand the companies can plan in better way to meet the demand.
    * Better planning on seasons when there is high demand.
    * Better planning on the days/hours have high demand.
    * Increase the profit by managing the bikes based on demand.
## Data Understanding
![DataFrame](https://github.com/PurushothamVadde/Bike-Demand-Prediction-With-Regression-Models-and-GridsearchCV/blob/main/Images/Dataframe.png)
* In the below table we can see the few rows of Bikesharing dataframe:
   * The dataframe has 17414 entries, from 0 to 17413.
   * All the features in the dataframe are numerical.
   * There are **0** Null values inthe complete dataframe.
   * The timestamp feature is splitted into Day, Month, Year and Hours features.
